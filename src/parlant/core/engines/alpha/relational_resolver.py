"""Relational resolver for guideline matching.

Resolves relationships between matched guidelines, including dependencies,
priorities, and entailment. The resolver iterates until stable, applying
each step in order:

  1. **Dependencies** — Filter guidelines whose dependency targets are not met.
     Uses topological sorting for single-pass resolution within each iteration.
  2. **Relational prioritization** — Filter guidelines that are deprioritized by
     higher-priority guidelines, tags, or journeys. Includes transitive filtering
     of guidelines that depend on deprioritized entities.
  3. **Numerical priority** — Keep only entities at the highest priority level.
     Runs before entailment so that entailed guidelines cannot cause their
     entailer to be filtered by having a higher priority.
  4. **Entailment** — Activate additional guidelines implied by matched ones.

The iteration loop (steps 1–4) runs until the set of matches stabilizes or
MAX_ITERATIONS is reached. This handles cross-step interactions, e.g. when
priority filtering removes a guideline that was a dependency target.
