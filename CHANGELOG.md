# Changelog

All notable changes to Parlant will be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add per-decision debug logs to journey node selection (`Journey '<title>': advanced/stayed/exited/completed/backtracked/auto-advanced/...`) so journey progression is visible at debug level alongside guideline matching
- Add a warning log for invalid condition ids returned during journey next-step selection

### Changed

- Rename journey `conditions` to `triggers` throughout the codebase, REST API, CLI, and SDKs to better reflect their role as activation signals. The REST API field, query parameter, and request bodies use `triggers` (no aliases). The Python SDK `Server.create_journey(...)` keeps `conditions=` as a deprecated keyword that emits a `DeprecationWarning`; passing both `triggers=` and `conditions=` raises an error. Existing journey records are migrated automatically by `parlant-prepare-migration` from the `journey_conditions` collection (with a `condition` field) to a new `journey_triggers` collection (with a `trigger` field). LLM prompt strings that include "Journey activation condition" are intentionally preserved
- Rename SDK callback `on_match` to `on_selected` on guidelines and journey state transitions to reflect that it fires post-resolution, when the entity is selected for message generation; `EngineHooks.on_guideline_match_handlers` and `on_journey_match_handlers` are renamed to `on_guideline_selected_handlers` and `on_journey_selected_handlers` accordingly
- Standardize guideline matcher log vocabulary: `"Activated"` → `"Matched"`, `"Skipped"` → `"Not matched"`, and `"Not applied"` → `"Unapplied"`
- Standardize relational resolver log vocabulary: `"Skipped: ... deactivated due to ..."` → `"Dropped (<reason>): ..."` with reasons `lower priority`, `unmet dependency`, `dependency on dropped entity`, `deprioritized by guideline`, and `deprioritized by journey`
- Disambiguation batch now uses the standard matcher vocabulary (`"Matched (disambiguation)"` / `"Not matched (disambiguation)"`) and emits a log on the negative branch (previously silent)
- Normalize observational batch rationale to plain `match.rationale` (no longer wrapped with `Condition Application Rationale: "..."`) for consistency with other batches
- Normalize low-criticality batch warning string to `"No checks generated"` to match other batches

### Removed

- Remove redundant `glm_service.py` NLP adapter and `NLPServices.glm()` factory method — the GLM/bigmodel.cn API is already covered by the existing Zhipu adapter (`zhipu_service.py`), which uses the official `zhipuai` SDK and supports GLM-4 model variants. Use `NLPServices.zhipu()` instead.

### Fixed

- Fix low-criticality matcher logging the entire inference blob once per guideline in a batch (N copies of the same payload at debug level); now logs a single per-item entry
- Fix WebSocketLogger event loop starvation — when no WebSocket clients are subscribed, the drain loop processed queued messages without yielding, progressively blocking the async event loop and causing increasing latency over time

### Security

- Upgrade dependencies to address known CVEs: authlib (>=1.6.11), requests (>=2.33.0), fastmcp (>=3.2.0), litellm (>=1.83.0), pytest (>=9.0.3), pyjwt (>=2.11.1), and constrain transitive deps — aiohttp, cryptography, pillow, pyopenssl, werkzeug, Mako, pyasn1, python-multipart, orjson, Pygments, diskcache
- Upgrade chat frontend: vite (>=7.3.2) and override transitive deps — picomatch, lodash, flatted, brace-expansion, immutable, yaml

## [3.3.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Allow passing ToolId when attaching tools throughout the SDK
- Add `AnyOf(tag)` and `AllOf(tag)` modifiers for explicit control over tag dependency semantics in `depend_on()` — `AnyOf` requires at least one tagged member to be active, `AllOf` requires all of them (bare `Tag` defaults to `AllOf`)
- Add `depend_on_any()` to `Guideline`, `Tag`, and `Journey` for OR dependency relationships — at least one target must be active. Multiple `depend_on_any()` calls create independent OR groups that are AND'd together
- Add event loop health monitoring to `/healthz` endpoint — measures callback latency and reports `healthy`, `degraded`, or `unhealthy` status with peak latency over a configurable window
- Add resolution tracking to the relational resolver — every entity that enters resolution gets a `Resolution` with a `ResolutionKind` (`NONE`, `DEPRIORITIZED`, `UNMET_DEPENDENCY_ALL`, `UNMET_DEPENDENCY_ANY`, `ENTAILED`) and structured `ResolutionDetails` (relationship ID, target IDs) explaining why

### Changed

- Split `RelationshipEntityKind.TAG` into `TAG_ALL` and `TAG_ANY` to support explicit tag dependency semantics at the core level (existing `TAG` entries treated as `TAG_ALL` for backwards compatibility)

### Fixed

- Fix priority and dependency relationships propagating through inactive intermediaries — only direct relationships now affect resolution, consistent with the reinstatement principle from argumentation theory
- Fix entailment recording only the highest-scoring source when multiple guidelines entail the same target — all entailing relationships are now recorded in resolution details
- Fix dep-failed guidelines not recovering when entailment satisfies their dependency target in a later iteration
- Fix SDK startup appearing stuck at 100% after evaluations — add "Applying evaluations" progress bar for the metadata-writing phase
- Fix `Variable.get_value()` returning `None` when called from a retriever, caused by retrievers starting before context variables were loaded
- Fix journey tool-state auto-advancing even when the tool did not run

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Add per-agent planners via `Server.create_agent(planner=...)`, allowing each agent to use a custom `Planner` implementation
- Accept `Tag` as a target in `depend_on()`, `exclude()`, and `prioritize_over()` on both `Guideline` and `Tag`, enabling relationships that target all guidelines sharing a custom tag
- Add `Tag.depend_on()`, `Tag.exclude()`, and `Tag.prioritize_over()` methods to the SDK, enabling tag-based dependency and priority relationships with guidelines and journeys
- Support custom TAG as source for DEPENDENCY relationships in the relational resolver
- Add `tags` parameter to `create_guideline`, `create_observation`, and `create_journey` on both `Agent` and `Journey`, allowing custom tags to be attached to entities at creation time
- Add `Tag.reevaluate_after()` method to the SDK, enabling tag-based reevaluation relationships with tools
- Add tag-based reevaluation support in the engine: when a tool fires, all guidelines carrying a tag that has a reevaluation relationship with that tool are now re-evaluated
- Add staged_events to GuidelineMatchingContext in SDK
- Add `priority` property to guidelines and journeys for priority-based filtering in the relational resolver
- Add transient guidelines (renamed from tool-provided guidelines), allowing tools to dynamically inject behavioral guidelines into the agent's context
- Add `Agent.utter()` to the SDK, enabling programmatic agent message generation with transient guidelines
- Add `Customer.update()` and `CustomerMetadata` to the SDK, allowing tools to update customer name and metadata
- Add `Session.update()`, `SessionMetadata`, and `SessionLabels` to the SDK, allowing tools to update session properties, metadata, and labels
- Add `customer`, `agent`, `mode`, and `title` properties to SDK `Session` class
- Add `Server.get_tag()` to the SDK, supporting lookup by either `id` or `name`
- Add name-based filtering to `TagStore.list_tags()` and the `GET /tags` API endpoint via an optional `name` query parameter
- Enforce tag name uniqueness in `TagStore`, raising an error when creating a tag with a duplicate name

### Changed

- Made extended thinking indicator optional in perceived performance policy
- Change `reevaluate_after()` on `Tag` and `Guideline` to accept multiple tools (`*tools`) and return `Sequence[Relationship]`
- Change `tags` field type from `Sequence[TagId]` to `Sequence[Tag]` on `Guideline`, `Journey`, `Capability`, `Term`, `Variable`, `Customer`, and `Agent` in the SDK
- Change `Tag.preamble()` to return a full `Tag` object instead of a `TagId`
- Upgrade MCP service and bump dependency versions to resolve security vulnerabilities

### Deprecated

- OpenAPI tool services are now deprecated; please migrate to SDK tool services
